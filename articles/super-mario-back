                               All season he's been criticized rather than appraised, and except for his very first match in a liverpool shirt (away to spurs) I would say he's been deservedly accused of so many things and he's done little to prove his critics wrong, until the league cup appearance at least.
    <br></br>
    But can Mario be super yet again? Balloteli in the past has shown that he's got the abilities and capabilities to become a cult hero and if he could just calm his hot head then he'll most probably become a world beater, this yet again is true but the Italian has done little to justify &pound;16M spent to aquire him in the summer. Lazy, Wasteful, Uncreative, Goal shy, Easy to defend against are some of the adjectives that have been used on balloteli since his arrival at merseyside and for the absence of sturridge and a formation he has complained about the star has looked out of sorts mostly at this point I would argue that this cannot be put on him.
    <br></br>
    The striker is one who thrives on the presence of a team mate around him as he doesn't make the kind of runs synonymous with liverpool therefore he needs someone to run in off him, against Spurs he had DS and looked really sharp, against Westbrom he had RS and tried to create chances and in the Capital one he had Borini and eventually scored, this makes a case as to whether he be played in the lone stroker role next match or paired with a fellow striker. When he's got a partner he's looked pretty sharp all the time, its not a light work load to come off the bench and inspire a comeback victory with so much pressure and media criticism weighing you down but that's exactly what he has done.
   <br></br>
   It was a good sight seeing him move in and out for and to passes, showed great character to get onto that cross for leveler at the tail to inspire a victory and from his performance yesterday he definately has given BR another though decision to make, maybe we finally are going to have 'super mario' afterall.
