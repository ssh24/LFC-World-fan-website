<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
Two late goals from two player under heavy pressure, secured a safe passage into the quarter-finals of the Capital one cups for Liverpool 
Goals from Balotelli and Lovern lifted the pressure on both themselves and the team. It had been over two hundred minutes since Liverpool had scored when Balotelli connected to a Borini cross as Anfield erupted. 
<br></br>
This wasn't the case for much of the first half with chances for both teams being few and far between. 
Liverpool were a team that were much changed. With the inclusion of Toure, Markovic and Borini, all of whom have been struggling to find a place in the team, Liverpool still faced the same spacing problems that have plagued them this whole campaign. But after good build up play through midfield, where the ball was rotated all the way from the right wing to the left, a chance fell to Markovic. Unfortunately for him it seems either nerves or rust form sitting on the bench had gotten to him as he wildly slashed his shot wide left. Tensions grew as Swansea came close after a well hit free kick that was parried by Jones. 
 <br></br>
After a dull first half the second started much the same. That was until Swansea's Emnes connected with a ball that bounced off two other players and landed on his left foot. Emnes proceeded to smash the ball past an out of place Jones for the opener.
 <br></br>
With the 2012 champions in the driving seat it didn't look like Liverpool were going to put up much of a fight. That was until Balotelli  replaced Lambert. The fresh pair of legs accelerated to meet a pin point cross from Borini. The cross had to be perfect. Narrowly avoiding the head of the first Swans defender to fall onto Balotelli's left toe to which the Kop exploded. 
<br></br>
With the tie rolling to what looked like extra time a mistake by the referee gave Liverpool a chance. Swansea's Fernandez saw straight red for a tackle deemed to be dangerous on Coutinho 25 yards from goal. Replays would later show that not only did Fernandez win the ball he also slid in with his knees. Not the two footed tackle many had thought to begin with. 
<br></br>
The resulting free kick to the back post allowed Lovren to nod home the winner. To add to the Swans misery it appears that Lovren's marker slips just at the wrong time as he takes off for the back post. 
<br></br>
Both Balotelli and Lovren must be feeling better about themselves after coming under fire from a slow start to the season. Hopefully they can take some of that confidence to Newcastle and secure not only 3 points but a good performance.
