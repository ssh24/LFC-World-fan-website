                              <p style="color:white;text-align:left">
                              Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers went for Mario Balotelli after missing
on Loic Remy due to medical issues.
<br></br>
Liverpool paid AC Milan 16m pounds to bring him at Anfield. Some called it a
gamble cause Balotelli's previous records aren't satisfying.
<br></br>
Balotelli has lots of talent which he never used properly. He becomes
angry often. Got many red cards in his career. Had a fight with his
previous ManCity boss Roberto Mancini. So its a big call for Brendan
Rodgers to sign a player like him.
<br></br>
Balotelli started his LFC career against Spurs. He alongside Sturridge
worked well. He got some good opportunities but couldn't convert them
into goals. People didn't take that seriously because it was his first
game.
<br></br>
Then international break started. During that Sturridge got injured
and Balotelli had to play as a lone striker. His performance wasn't
satisfying. He got his first goal with Liverpool against Ludogorets
and the only one so far.
<br></br>
His performance was below average in recent weeks.
<br></br>
What went wrong: This season our defence was very sloppy. Plus the
injury of Joe Allen forced us to avoid 442 diamond formation. Sloppy
defence made a bad impact on our Midfielders also. They didn't perform
really well. Balotelli also didnt get many key passes from them. So he
tried to score goals by his own. Didn't pass to the midfielders and
didn't create many chances. He was very isolated. Whenever he got the
ball, he shooted from every angle. Most of them were off target. On
some occasion he was very lazy. Thats why his performance was below
average.
<br></br>
His positives: In past Balotelli was very lazy on the field. But now
he works really hard. He continuously make runs. Often come down help
the defenders. He also marks players during corners which he never did
in past. He is also learning to control his temper. So far he has been
tackled from behind lots of times but he didn't react aggressively.
He's trying his best to avoid these incidents. Also he is a brilliant
free kick taker.
<br></br>
Balotelli was dropped against West Brom. He played the last 30
minutes. Expecting that he has understood if he doesnt perform, he'll
be dropped. So that might affect his performance against West Brom. He
played really well. He supplied a wonderful key pass to Sterling(which
is a rare thing for him) but unfortunately Sterling wasn't able to
convert that. Gerrard helped him a lot when SG played as a CAM for the
last 15 minutes. He and Gerrard played some wonderful 1 to 1 passes.
Balotelli was very selective on shooting. He just shoot the perfect
balls. 2 out of 3 were on target. For the first time(with LFC) he
tried to break the offside trap. He tried but Sterling couldn't supply
the perfect ball.
<br></br>
So we can see that Balotelli is trying his best to improve his game.
Slowly he's adapting with our style. He prefers to play just behind a
CF. Alongside Sturridge, he'd do well hopefully. He just need to
improve his mobility. Try to break the offside trap more often and go
forward. He should be more selective on shooting. It would be better
to pass than shooting from distance.
<br></br>
Strikers usually take a bit time to settle. We have to give Balotelli
time. He is one of the most talented players in Europe. Just need the
correct polish to bring the best out of him. If he works hard & listen
to Rodgers' instruction properly, he'll be a deadly striker.
