                             Good Bye, Luis. 
                             <br></br>
Thanks for everything you did for us at last few years. We do never forget your devotion, hard work, and love to our community and those incredible contributions to our club, especially for that long-awaited champion's league spot- you helped much to secure. We'll keep you in our mind forever. How can we forget your thrilling appearances on pitch, those 69 goals, 6 hat-tricks, that desperate run to regain ball after losing from your feet, long range goals from mid line, and all spectacular flawless free kicks? Once I close my eyes, I can still see everything you gave to us. We wish you best possible luck for your future. Be careful, where you now are, that's not Anfield and you mayn't find everything readymade easy like before.
<br></br> 
Luis, it hurts to see you with another club's jersey on pitch.  There, you do look after yourself. No one would back you at your tough time as we did before; remember my words. They will even may tune to either "Meri Bhabhi" or "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" when you mistakenly miss a sure goal scoring chance. They may show you how it feels hot at side bench after your two consequent lackluster performance. Few off them also already starts to calculate how ineffective you were in your first appearance- you may not believe! Stop behaving wild at your present state. It's the kingdom of Messi, not yours- always mind it. If you do something harmful to their star player's cute boy image, you unfortunately, beyond our expectation, may be kicked out from there. Don't believe me? Then, talk to Ibrahimovic! We, as your previous club's supporter, never intend to see you thrown away from another club.  Be aware of them, be aware!! If any troubles come around, remind Anfield's match-time salient Environment, you may find enough to motivate yourself at those scenario. We all are always with you surrounded with our eternal love.Oh, wait, I almost forget to mention, there still remain an evergreen Liverpudlian Agent with you. You can frankly always demand helps and supports you needed from him, yes, you've picked the name of right one- Javier Mascherano. Just see around and go to his door, and just say - 'we both from same mother', then he never reject you- although their supporters may do. Be meticulous to your attitude and produce some sagacious steps ahead, otherwise I am anxious about your smooth future there. Just remember, we never wish worse to you, never did to our former players as well.
 <br></br>
 We miss you at every single day of your post departure time, especially at Tuesday/Wednesday night. You made our dream true, but now you've gone away! May be, that's the modern football, that's life also how it goes! You confess or not, you too miss the pre-kick off scenario at our worship place, raising both hand all of presence with muffler written "You'll never walk alone". On-match thriller and appearances of gallery would still fascinate you. 
<br></br>
You may ask why I am writing those words after the huge time gone. Believe me, I never trust anyone's holy-quotation of making news to out you of Anfield. Even after watching video, you sneaking after Ivan Rakitic, I did not believe though. But after watching you with another shirt on La Liga, I found myself convinced to assure me about 'No Chance of Reconciliation of Suarez's game start for Reds'. It's , sorry to say, high time to remove you from my desktop background with red shirt, as you no longer wear it any more. Actually I forgot how to change the background as I need not change it for a long period of time with yours one image of mighty red shirt. But, alas, this time I have to, may replace with your previous partner Sterling.  
<br></br>
We will miss you lot, Luis.  We will wait for one day come, you will back to our home. Will watch you again at Anfield strolling with one Red Kit and wave your hands to us. Waiting until that dreamy day come. 
<br></br>
We love you, Luis, we love you. Remember us, your previous love, till the last breathe of your life as we everyone, Liverpudlian, does.
<br></br>
You'll never walk alone, never do! 
(It's not produce to hurt any other club. If anyone feel it does, may be due to coincidence, sorry to them. )
