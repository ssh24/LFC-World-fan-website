<i><b>Jamie Carragher: 'It doesn't matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play 9 games in a month,
                              like Raheem did, it will leave a mark on you physically'.</b></i>
                              
                              <br></br>
                              
                              You could be forgiven for forgetting that Raheem Sterling is only 19. Such is the improvement in his game over the last year, he has developed rapidly to become a key, if not the most important, player for both club and country. All at the age where he's meant to be experimenting with drugs, flirting on Facebook and getting a 'proper job'.
                     <br></br>
Sterling is a young man in demand. His consistently excellent form last season and during the start of this has seen his status fly on a worldwide scale. The inevitable press talk of a &pound;1500000000000000- a-week move to Barcelona or PSG has begun and Liverpool fans couldn't be blamed for being nervous about the situation.
              <br></br>
At such a young age, it is not beneficial to either Liverpool or England for Sterling to be played relentlessly week in, week out. Rodgers rested him against Aston Villa at home after two games in that week already. At his age, he is still developing and, whilst fitter than most men older him, he still has a way to go until he is at the same level as his peers.
              <br></br>
One day, 50 games a season will be a minimum requirement and an expectation for him, as it is with all the other biggest stars in the world. Arguably it already is. There is shock when he is not on the starting line-up. It is important not to burn him out. One serious, or even niggling, injury could seriously set back what has the potential to be an exceptional career.
              <br></br>
Don't forget, Liverpool fans have seen this before. At 19, Michael Owen was also a key man in the Anfield setup.  He was touted for greatness and, for a couple of years, he achieved just that. However, that blistering pace he was so known for was never quite the same after he was injured against Leeds in 1999 aged, you guessed it, 19.
             <br></br>
Owen, in an article with the Telegraph, states:
              <br></br>
 <i>'That massive injury at Leeds probably changed and shaped my whole career. Since I was 19, I've been compromised'.</i>
              <br></br>
 Without those injuries, Owen's 40 England goal tally would be much higher, possibly the highest of all. As it stands however, he left Liverpool at aged 24 and his career petered out to an extent from there on in, never reaching the same heights as what was expected of him.
              <br></br>
Sterling faces the same risk. Like Owen, he relies on immense bursts of pace and quick ball control to have the impact he does. The extreme physical strain on his body would be tough on anyone, let alone a 19 year old man.
              <br></br>
Here is where Roy Hodgson comes in. The England manager has incurred the wrath of his former employers with a seemingly blatant disregard for the opinions of the club managers he has to contend with. They're not asking him to be unreasonable, just have some consideration for the player's wellbeing and its effect on the club.
              <br></br>
England are like the kid that steals the best toys at school, breaks them and gives them back without an apology. When Daniel Sturridge was injured last season on England duty during training, he played the full 90 minutes of a friendly against Germany despite the pain. He had to be dropped to the bench for the Merseyside Derby that followed the next week, infuriating Brendan Rodgers in the meantime.
                <br></br>
Rodgers and Hodgson have a fractious relationship at best. Hodgson has excluded Sturridge from the latest squads for San Marino and Estonia, both of which games were won. He was seemingly under pressure from Rodgers to make the decision and the rift has re-opened the whole 'club v country' debate. Now the Sterling situation has probably lost Hodgson any hope he may have had of being invited to the Christmas party this year.
               <br></br>
His criticism of Liverpool's policy on 'two day recovery periods', insisting 'the Germans don't do that' showed his naivety. Bayern Munich had three days off recently after a game, returning to training fresh, fit and beyond risk of aggravating a niggle picked up during the game. This was the cornerstone of Liverpool's success last season.
            <br></br>
Hodgson's inability to shelve his pride and accept that his players value and consider their club careers when it comes to playing for the national side saw him hang Sterling out to dry in the press declaring that 'he said he was a bit tired and asked to sit this one out' as if he'd just asked if he could fly home for a party. Roy, this is one of the best players you have, and will probably ever have - if it's in his best interest to rest in a game against Estonia, then so be it. You would hope they could win the game without him. A side full of Premier League stars? You'd have thought so.
       <br></br>
As for Sterling? 'Excuse me for being human,' he tweeted. That's okay Raheem, as long as you carry on being super-human on the pitch. There's a reason Brendan Rodgers is the Liverpool manager overseeing a Champions League campaign, whilst Hodgson lasted less than six months. Do what you do, ignore the others.
     <br></br>
