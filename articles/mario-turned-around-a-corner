                              The world of football loves a crisis. In the frantic and often cut-throat environment that is football in 2014, a club in crisis can develop very quickly. Less than three months into the 2014/2015 Premier League season, and many have described Liverpool FC as a "club in crisis."
	<br></br>
	Granted, many of Liverpool's performances this season have been painfully lacklustre, arguably owing to the loss of star Uruguayan Luis Suarez. The club sit seventh in the Premier League, having won four of their nine opening games, losing three with two draws. 
<br></br>
Losses against Manchester City, Aston Villa and West Ham have proved tough to watch, with many blaming poor performances on manager Brendan Rodgers. Defeats in the Champions League to FC Basel, and Real Madrid, have not helped.
<br></br>
Yet the club's latest result could prove vital. A league cup tie against in-form Swansea City brought with it the same old problems; defensive frailties saw Liverpool trailing to a Marvin Emnes finish, with the home side leaning towards a cup exit on a whimper. Cue Mario Balotelli.
<br></br>
The Italian striker arrived at Anfield with a reputation. Introduced as a seventy-ninth minute substitution, Balotelli dragged the Reds from the brink, finishing from an excellent Fabio Borini delivery. He continued his disruption, causing trouble among the Swansea defence, leading to an injury-time winner, delivering Liverpool into the last eight of the competition.
<br></br>
To Liverpool fans, Balotelli's appearance could prove to be much more than a cup-tie cameo; the Italian has been largely criticised since his arrival, including striking condemnation from former player and manager Graeme Souness. However, his brief involvement against Swansea brought with it work-rate, some impressive movement, and the all-important finish.
<br></br>
While Balotelli may not be the finished article for those expecting a fully-fledged Luis Suarez replacement, a blossoming relationship with fellow-Italian Borini, and the soon-to-return Daniel Sturridge, could make some movement to fill the void.
<br></br>
Whether results go their way or not, the pressure will be on Balotelli to continue to produce. Sturridge's injury has proved costly in terms of how Liverpool go about their play, with the media keen to pounce.
<br></br>
Wednesday, 29 October. Seventh in the Premier League and just three points off third place, quarter-finals of the league cup, group stages of the Champions League, with the FA Cup still to play. Crisis? What crisis?
