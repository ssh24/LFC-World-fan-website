                 <h2>Liverpool Recall Brad Smith from Swindon</h2>
                              <img src="11.jpg" Width="500" Height="300"  style="border:thick double #300000"/>

                              <p style="color:white;text-align:left">
                              
                             Brad Smith has been recalled by parent club Liverpool, and in doing so cutting his loan spell at Swindon Town to a premature. The left-back made 10 appearances for Swindon in his short time in Wiltshire, but has been recalled to the first team by manager Brendan Rodgers. The Liverpool boss has defensive concerns ahead of Liverpool's games with Real Madrid in the Champions League and Hull in the Premier League.
                                   <br></br>
Smith did miss a lot of first team football at Swindon because of injuries and international duty. Smith had been struggling with a groin injury but recovered to feature for Australia in their games with Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. Smith, 20, was originally part of England's international set up and Under 20 and Under 21 level but opted to represent Australia instead.
                                  <br></br>
Despite predominantly playing at left-back, where cover is currently needed at Liverpool, Smith played all but one of his games for the League One side on the left side of midfield.
                                 <br></br>
Smith was recalled a day after Alberto Moreno was left out the squad in Liverpool's win at QPR. The former Sevilla man had been rested rather than injured, but there were still injury concerns over the summer signing. The current left-back Jose Enrique had his performance questioned in the same game, despite only just returning after a long injury lay off.
                                 <br></br>
This may be the reason why Smith has returned to Anfield, but the club have not commented on any reason at this time. Upon hearing the news, Swindon manager Mark Cooper admitted it was out of hands, but did pay tribute to the left-back.
                                 <br></br>
"He's started to look as if he was going to produce. It took him [Brad Smith] a while to get used to the way we played but it is one of those things, Liverpool have recalled him. We can't do anything about it. He's full of pace, very quick, a great lad and I'm sure he will go and have a fantastic career in the game. Hopefully in the future, we will have the opportunity to bring him back."
