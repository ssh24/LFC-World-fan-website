                              Welcome back Reds, we have got a little different and special Fan Focus today. We will be featuring one of our younger Reds Grant age 8. I asked Grant's Dad Tom if he wanted to do the Fan Focus and he had the great suggestion to feature his LFC loving son Grant instead of himself. We had Tom who if you follow us on twitter I'm sure you've seen some pictures of a cute little kid with LFC gear on going to school, interview his son. One of their pictures actually got on the show LFC World on LFC TV. This Fan Focus will let us get a view from a younger generations perspective. For most of us we had long stretches where you might not be able to see LFC play because they weren't on TV or you had to dig through the internet to find info and updates. In Grant's case he has grown up in this instant information age and has always had access to the team on TV and online pretty easily. It is great to see the knowledge the kid has acquired so early and to see the Love and Passion he has for the club at a young age. Take it away guys...                            
                              <br></br>
                              
                              <b>Names</b>: Tom and Grant Paskus (<a href="https://twitter.com/tspaskus" target="_blank">@tspaskus</a>)
                              
                              <br></br>
                              
                              <b>Tom</b>: I don't think my Liverpool history is very interesting relative to the other Indy Reds profiled so far. I didn't play any soccer growing up. Once I gave up on my hoop dreams, I ended up running cross country and track at Dartmouth College. I watched my first soccer game at Dartmouth, where some guy named Andrew Shue (Melrose Place anyone?) led our team to an Ivy League championship. The soccer bug fully took hold when I arrived at the University of Virginia for graduate school in 1990 (UVA won four straight NCAA titles during my time there) and I decided to give rec-league soccer a try. My teammates included Mia Hamm's sister, while our arch-rivals included a woman who would end up becoming my wife. That meet-cute story involves my now-wife's friend kicking a prone goalkeeper (me) in a "non-preferred" location. Anyway, we now have two kids, and our boy (Grant, age 8) has graduated from having his dad coach him the game to playing club soccer for FC Pride. He is a Liverpool fanatic. His life (and wardrobe and bedroom) revolves around the club and he's pulled the whole family into Liverpool fandom. Here's how Grant responded when I interviewed him about LFC (my commentary in parentheses):
                              
                              <br></br>
                              
                              <b>What do you like to do in your free time when you're not at school?</b>
When I'm not at school I really just like to play soccer a lot and kick the ball around (yes, he's destroying our house). I play with LEGOs sometimes and play FIFA on my Kindle.
<br></br>


<b>Do you follow other sports?</b>
I follow football and basketball a little.

<br></br>

<b>You read a lot of books too. Have you read any Liverpool books?</b>
I have a few. Mom and I just read Steven Gerrard's autobiography together on the Kindle. I also have the Pocket Book of Liverpool, 120 Men Who Made LFC, and Liverpool the Comic Strip History (all sit by his bed).

<br></br>

<b>Who's your favorite player on the current Liverpool team?</b>
I really like how Lallana and Moreno are performing this season. Steven Gerrard even though he's getting a little old maybe. (He was a big Suarez fan and has taken the loss hard.)

<br></br>

<b>Who do you like among the young or on-loan players?</b>
I'd like to see what Jordon Ibe can do when he comes back. (Affinity first developed for Ibe because Grant wears #33 for his club team.)

<br></br>

<b>Besides Liverpool, what other teams do you like to follow?</b>

I like Derby and Real Madrid some. I like Atletico Madrid a little bit even though they're rivals of Real Madrid. And I like PSG some too. (I'm reading my edited rendition of 'I am Zlatan' to him at bedtime. Nightmares are now common for both of us.)

<br></br>

<b>If you could meet or have dinner with any LFC player/manager ever who it would it be & why?</b> It would probably be Brendan Rodgers. I would just like to see what he thinks on how the season's going and how they're going to get better. And just like what he's working on with them.

<br></br>


<b>How about any others from the past teams you'd like to meet?</b>
I'd like to meet Kenny Dalglish or Luis Suarez. Oh yeah, I really like how Dirk Kuyt played for us.

<br></br>

<b>How did you pick Liverpool as your team?</b>
One day you were showing me a website where you could pick your favorite team and I read the description for Liverpool. It said if you like Bill Russell more than Michael Jordan, because he won more titles, than you probably like Liverpool. So, yeah.

<br></br>
<b>You watch a lot of soccer and old videos and LFC TV - do you have a favorite Liverpool moment or goal?</b> Well, I have one moment and one goal. My favorite moment was from last year when Coutinho scored in the game against City where they won 3-2. I just felt like we could conquer the league. And the goal was when they played Norwich at Anfield where Suarez got four goals. That one (the third goal) where he just popped it over the defender's head, leaned his weight to one side and shot the ball the other way.
                              
 <br></br>

<b>You weren't born yet when Istanbul happened. But you have checked out the Liverpool "Champions of Europe 2005" DVD from the Lawrence public library about a hundred times, right? It's been in your possession more than the library's over the past year? If somebody from the LFC Indy club wanted to watch it they'd have to come find you, right? So what was your favorite moment of the Istanbul final?</b> I just thought it was really cool. It would have been nice if I was there when it happened. It just seemed exciting and it would have been great if you were there at the stadium. I liked the celebration by Xabi Alonso and his teammates when he got the rebound and scored off the penalty kick.
<br></br>
<b>When you watch a Liverpool match do you have any superstitions?</b>
Well, I like to wear my Liverpool shirt with you but it doesn't always work.  
<br></br>
<b>No, it doesn't always work. What do you do if Liverpool loses a match?</b>
Run upstairs, put the blankets over my head and cry for a little while. (Boy laughs at saying that, but very true on match day. Reason he's hesitant about us going to UJ for matches.)  
<br></br>
<b>You've learned all about the Liverpool kits-what's your favorite?</b>
The one I really like is the 1993-1995 home kit. The shirt had some darker red lines on it and the white stripes on the shirt and the shorts. (He's also mentioned the old green kits previously. Like all young kids today, he likes crazy color schemes and neon anything. He actually thought last year's away kits were cool.)
<br></br>
<b>You are in charge of Liverpool for 1 day... what do you do?</b>
I'd probably try to sharpen up the team a little bit with some new signings-maybe another center back, a striker and a goalkeeper. I'd like to get Jordon Ibe back. And work with the team on their attacking and creative play, and making good passes and touches.
<br></br>
<b>Anybody you'd let go?</b>
I don't want to say. Maybe Glen Johnson. (He probably heard that one from his dad.)
<br></br>
<b>Have you ever seen Liverpool play in person?</b>
Yeah, I went to Soldier Field in Chicago to see the Olympiakos game. I thought it was really interesting just being around all the fans. It was fun. It would be fun to go to Anfield someday. I'd also like to go to the Stadium of Light (Sunderland).
<br></br>
<b>If Liverpool won the league, where would you go for a celebratory dinner?</b>
I'd would probably go to Buffalo Wild Wings so I could eat lots of wings and watch the highlights again and again and again.
<br></br>
<b>What makes you most proud to be a Liverpool fan?</b>
Just what the atmosphere is at Anfield and stuff. And just how our supporters are good and how Rodgers is usually good.
<br></br>
<b>Any other team that would consider you a big supporter?</b>
Yeah, we support Indy Eleven (he's been to most of the games and likes sitting with the Brickyard Battalion). I really like their goalkeeper, Kristian Nicht. And probably A.J. Corrado and Dylan Mares because they're two of my coaches (at the FC Pride club).
