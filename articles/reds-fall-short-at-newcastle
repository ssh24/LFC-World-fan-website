                            Newcastle were still basking in the glow of a great midweek away win at City going into this game, Alan Pardew, often an isolated figure at St. James in the past months would be rallying his men for a crack at a Liverpool side not quite yet into their stride.
            <br></br>                
Brendan Rodgers got a much needed home win against Swansea this week, and both sides went into the game with a degree of optimism.
The major surprise for me was the omission of Fabio borini, who surely deserves to start after a good performance midweek and given his decent goal return against the toon.
<br></br>
Rodgers 3-5-2 formation was meant to give licence to his full backs but Liverpool struggled to play with any fluidity in the first half. 
They lacked urgency and tempo and there was worrying signs of hesitancy from both Johnson and Moreno in the early exchanges.
Once again Mario Ballotelli struggled to get involved up front on his own, but any striker needs a good supply from his teammates to flourish and he simply was offered nothing in the first half.
<br></br>
Some of Liverpool's best football last season came with two forwards up top and surely they will revert to this when Daniel Sturridge retains fitness.
As the half drew to a close Newcastle caused problems from a few set pieces and Martin Skrtel should have scored with a free header from a rare Liverpool corner.
The second half began much in the same manner with both sides struggling to make an impact, for a fixture usually full of goals this one was not one for the neutral.
Liverpool's general sluggishness continued and gradually allowed Newcastle to take control.
<br></br>
A potent attack down the right resulted in Newcastle substitute Azoye being gifted a goal.
No-one in red seemed surprised, and only a good save from Mignolet stopped Liverpool from further embarrassment.
Rodgers threw on Lambert and Borini but it was too little too late, Alarm bells are ringing on the Kop, he needs to produce a run of results, and fast.
