                             <h3 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h3>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
It has not been a vintage week at Anfield. The Real Madrid game last week, whilst a tall order, was a chance for the Reds to show they can compete with the big boys of European, and indeed world, football. Instead, they were comfortably beaten with what can only be described as a master class. Jordan Henderson said that the team had been 'naèª°ve' in their approach to the game and it would be hard to disagree. This, combined with the exceptionally poor result on the weekend against Hull, has placed perhaps more significance on Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against Swansea. A positive result could lift the mood and reinstall confidence. The reds have excited in spurts, frustrated in parts and generally struggled to reach the dizzying heights accomplished by last season's remarkable campaign.  In particular, they have failed to cope it seems without the talismanic influence of the great Luis Suarez (god bless him).
<br></br>
Injuries have been cruel already, robbing Brendan Rodgers of the services of Adam Lallana, Joe Allen and, most significantly perhaps, striker Daniel Sturridge. The impact Sturridge has on the Liverpool side became apparent last season as he bagged 21 goals in the Premier League, finishing second only to his South American strike partner. His absence has blighted Liverpool's progress over the last few weeks. You get the impression that the players brought in were done so with building a team around Sturridge in mind and his absence has left the team looking disjointed and lacking in pace going forward, something that became such a key feature of the team last season.
 <br></br>
The Swans come into this game with a mixed bag of recent results, most recently a relatively comfortable win over Leicester at home thanks to a brace from Wilfried Bony. Bony, a rumoured target for Liverpool over the summer, has been a revelation since his move to South Wales. You can't help but wonder where Liverpool would be now had he pulled on the red shirt this season, rather than the misfiring ball of ego that is Mario Balotelli. Without banging on about it, the Balotelli experiment has, so far, not worked at all and talk of a January departure, whilst premature, is not something that a number of fans find themselves disagreeing with. Such is the lack of intensity in his game, Rodgers has been forced to admit that Mario is struggling to adapt to 'the Liverpool way' and change his attitude at a club that does not allow for egos to take over.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Team News</h3>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
Under normal circumstances, you may expect to see a vastly different set of teams line up to start this game. Cup ties are usually a good opportunity to test out the younger, fresher members of the squad and give the senior players a rest at the same time. Rodgers has an interesting dilemma on his hands here. Does he push forward with a strong side to do everything he can to progress to the next round, or give youth a chance? Or does he, instead, lose faith with the players who have provided a string of poor performances in recent weeks and allow for the fringe players to push their claim for a starting berth in future fixtures? I think it could be the latter.
      <br></br>
I will be very surprised if we see Balotelli from the off against Garry Monk's side. This sort of game could be the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to finally give Rickie Lambert a proper chance to lead the line for the reds or perhaps Fabio Borini could get a chance against his former teammates. This seems unlikely however, with Borini reportedly furious at being snubbed for a place in the match squad against both QPR and Real Madrid. His pace and direct running is something that sections of Reds fans have been crying out for recently to try and compensate for the lack of pace and intent that has been present up front so far. After scoring in the last round against Middlesbrough, 17 year old Jordon Rossiter may also be given another chance to impress in midfield. Steven Gerrard and Joe Allen could also be rested, having both played every game in the last week. The reds have a heavy fixture list coming up, so rotation will be essential. Jordan Henderson did not start at the weekend and I would expect him to start, but perhaps Emre Can keeps his place after his impressive performance in the dour weekend fixture. Here is the team that I would pick, taking into consideration the likeliness of wholesale changes:

Whatever side Brendan puts out, they will have to be much better than they have been in recent weeks. Swansea are no pushovers and possess some serious threat, particularly with the emergence of Jonjo Shelvey as something of a midfield maestro since his move from L1 to the Valleys. The pace of Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge on the wings will be a test for Liverpool's leaky defence which, again, needs to rapidly improve. 2 clean sheets in 19 fixtures is not good enough. Rodger's assertion that the Reds do not need a defensive coach is somewhat baffling, in light of the performances. Dejan Lovren has failed to live up to his billing as a commanding influence, the like of which we have lacked since the retirement of Jamie Carragher. I miss you Jamie, I really, really do.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Previous Meetings</h3>

  <p style="color:white;text-align:left;text-align:left">
  These sides last met in this competition in October 2012. A sensational Swans performance saw them run out 3-1 winners at Anfield, at the time holders of the trophy, en route to their historic cup triumph. Liverpool were poor that night and Monk's predecessor Michael Laudrup was praised for his attacking, dynamic tactics that perhaps took the reds by surprise. So often do teams come to Anfield and sit back, looking to frustrate that Rodgers' side were unable to cope with the intensity of that night. Under Monk, the Swans are not quite as explosive, rather focusing on getting the ball to their target man up front in Bony but still exploit the wings if given the opportunity.
<br></br>
City have proved something of an issue for Liverpool at times, in particular last season. Victor Moses rescued a draw for the Reds at the Liberty stadium and only a late winner from Jordan Henderson spared the blushes at Anfield last season in an exciting 4-3 win that again highlighted the Liverpool policy of 'you score three, we'll score four' rather than a focus on solid defending. Will this be enough to fend off Monk's side tomorrow or will the Swans punish a defence chronically low on confidence once more?

     <h3 style="text-align:center">Predictions</h3>
     
     <p style="color:white;text-align:left;text-align:left">
     Cup games are always tough to predict. On paper, Liverpool certainly have a stronger squad than their Welsh counterparts. What isn't so clear is how much a part the form book will go on to play in shaping the game as a contest. Swansea have had a good start to the season, ahead of Liverpool in sixth place. They would, you assume, play a strong side as cup competitions often hold a great deal of significance for teams with lower expectations and lesser ability to maintain a top of the table challenge. Their victory in 2012, defeating Bradford City in the final, was an advert for British football and a compliment to the desire and will of teams to take games seriously, something that the bigger sides have often been accused of not doing.
         <br></br>
However, I think the Reds will eventually come out on top in this match-up. It is not ridiculous to suggest that there are serious chances for players on the outside of the first team to fight their way in, such is Liverpool's struggle to find form this season and I think they will be hungry enough, along with the need to impress a crowd struggling to find positives in a so far depressingly ordinary start to the season.
