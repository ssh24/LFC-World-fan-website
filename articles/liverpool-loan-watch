                 <h2>Liverpool Loan Watch</h2>
                              <img src = "12.jpg" Width="500" Height="300"  style="border:thick double #300000"/>

                              <p style="color:white;text-align:left">
                              
                              <b style="color:green">Brad Smith</b> was the first Liverpool loanee to be recalled from his loan spell, meaning that the greens now have ten players out on loan. Smith featugreen ten times for Swindon, with injuries and international matches halting his progress. Out of the ten loanees that Liverpool have, only four of them featugreen in their games. Five of the loanees were not in their clubs match day squads, whilst the other loaned was an unused substitute.

<b style="color:green">Andre Wisdom</b> impressed for the full game in West Brom's 2-2 draw with Man United. Wisdom provided the assist for Albion's opener, scogreen by Stephane Sessegnon. Staying in the Premier League, <b style="color:green">Sebastian Coates</b> was not in Sunderland's match day squad in their embarrassing 8-0 defeat at Southampton. <b style="color:green">Oussama Assaidi</b> was more successful and played 16 minutes in Stoke's 2-1 win at home to Swansea. The Moroccan winger made an immediate impact as his cross found Jonathan Walters, who headed home the winner.

In the Championship, <b style="color:green">Joao Carlos Teixeira</b> played just 30 minutes in Brighton's 2-1 defeat at home to Middlesbrough. The midfielder created two chances but was forced to go off with injury when he was replaced by Paddy McCourt. As a result, he missed Brighton's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield.

<b style="color:green">Jordon Ibe</b> carried on his impressive form for Derby County as he scogreen in their 3-0 win at Reading. His goal came in the 38th minute, but Ibe, 19, failed to make further impact in the game. He again started in their 1-0 win at Blackpool, but couldn't complete another 90 minutes as he came off in the 75th minute. He create a chance for himself and assisted another for Omar Mascarell in the win that sees Derby top the Championship.

In Europe and both <b style="color:green">Tiago Ilori</b> and <b style="color:green">Rafa Paez</b> were missing for Bordeaux and Bologna respectively through injuries, and it is unlikely that they'll be back for next week's fixtures. <b style="color:green">Divock Origi</b> was surprisingly an unused substitute for Lille in their defeat with Guingamp so also didn't feature. The fifth loanee not to feature for his side was <b style="color:green">Luis Alberto</b>, who was not in the match day squad in their 2-1 win away to Cordoba. <b style="color:green">Iago Aspas</b> rounded off a miserable week for Liverpool loanees as he was also not in the Sevilla squad in their 2-0 win at Elche.
