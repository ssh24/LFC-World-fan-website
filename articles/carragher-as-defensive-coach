                 <h2>Rodgers Should Bring Carragher Back To Sort Out Defence</h2>

                              Liverpool continue to have defensive problems despite bringing in two new full-backs and a centre half in the summer. Dejan Lovren was heralded as a leader that could martial the Reds defence and prevent Rodgers' defence from conceding too many goals, but the goals are still being leaked at the back and this is bigger concern than last season because Liverpool are struggling to score goals with Luis Suarez no longer at Anfield and Daniel Sturridge constantly injured.
 <br></br>
Sturridge and Suarez helped paper over the cracks with their goals but ultimately Liverpool's defensive record cost them the Premiership title. Rodgers tried to explain the defensive problems at a recent press conference when he said:
 <br></br>
“Our problem and the issue we have which we need to find the solution for is our lack of coaching time. Take this week, we played Wednesday night , the players physically recover on Thursday, and that leaves us with only a short period of time on the training field before we've got the game on Saturday.”
 <br></br>
Rodgers excuse doesn't make sense when his side only played one game-a-week last season and Liverpool still conceded too many goals and he had all week to coach his players.
 <br></br>
Rodgers needs to have a serious look at his current defensive coaching methods because it is not working and maybe he should ask Jamie Carragher to come back as a coach, to coach the defence, because the former Liverpool defender has been sorely missed since retiring and I think he would be the best man to sort out the Reds' defensive problems.
