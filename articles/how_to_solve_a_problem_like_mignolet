                                 When Simon Mignolet joined Liverpool last year, there was an air of intrigue and guarded concern about his arrival.
                              In signing from Sunderland, he became the instant new number one. Whilst not certified at the time, this decision
                              went on to end Pepe Reina's time as the man between the Liverpool sticks. He was shipped out to Napoli,
                              reunited with Rafael Benitez as Brendan Rodgers looked to stamp his identity on his young, exciting Liverpool squad.
                              <br></br>
                              Mignolet had impressed pundits and fans alike for some exceptional match-winning performances that many credited as 
                              one of the reasons the club managed to narrowly escape relegation to the Championship. He kept 30 clean sheets in
                              89 league appearances for Sunderland. For a side in the lower realms of the league, this is not a bad record and 
                              prompted him to start to gain something of a reputation. At the same time, Reina was starting to show the signs of 
                              a complacent, fatigued goalkeeper. The mistakes grew in frequency and the overall performances dropped to a point 
                              where he was, for the first time in his Liverpool career, having his position as first choice stopper called in to question.
                              <br></br>
Brendan Rodgers has always said he is not afraid to make big decisions - he is a firm believer in things being the 'Liverpool way' and that no player 
is bigger than the club. He effectively wrote Andy Carroll off as a lost cause, offloading him despite the financial implications for the club. 
Reina was next in the firing line. Rodgers was determined that Liverpool were going to push for fourth place and this required a keeper that 
their defenders could completely rely on to provide the support they needed. Mignolet was brought in, known for his shot stopping and it was 
believed he could be the missing link.
<br></br>
The ecstasy of his penalty saving heroics on his debut aside, Mignolet has so far failed to prove that Rodgers has upgraded from the days of Reina. 
He started so well, keeping 3 clean sheets in his first four games and pulling off match winning saves such as the late stop from Christian Benteke 
at Villa away last season. There is no doubt Mignolet is a superb shot stopper; his reflexes are quick and he can pull off the 'tv saves' but there 
are elements of his game that let him down enormously. I know I am not the only fan that hold their breath every time a corner or free kick is conceded. 
On numerous occasions, Mignolet dashes off his line, flies into the path of the ball and, worryingly often, misses the flight of the ball entirely. 
These have come to cost Liverpool dearly at times (think Southampton at Anfield last year) and are not acceptable of a Premier League goalkeeper.
<br></br>
He does not have the same command of his area as his peers. Keepers such as Joe Hart and Thibault Courtois lead their defence when the ball is 
anywhere near them. They come out decisively when needs be and stay on the line when the defenders are better suited to the clearance. Mignolet does not
have that relationship or understanding with his defence. In part, this could be due to the number of different defenders he has had in front of him. 
The Reds have suffered with injuries over the past year in their defence and he has played with no fewer than 10 different defenders in various 
combinations in front of him. This lack of continuity is something not an issue for the other big hitters in the Premier League such as Chelsea 
who have a solid back four that play together week in week out, know each other's game and feed off this understanding to concede very few goals.
<br></br>
Liverpool's defensive frailties are one thing, but there have been high-profile error from Mignolet. Last season, he was directly responsible for 4 goals 
that Liverpool conceded, nearly 10% of their entire total (50). They were big goals as well. A second goal in a home game against Villa where a point was salvaged. 
Could have been 3. A flat-footed, flailing attempt to stop Alvaro Negredo's scuffed hit that resulted in what proved to be a damaging defeat away at City on Boxing 
day and the next weekend at Chelsea left Mignolet low of confidence for what seemed like the rest of the season. Rodgers' noted this, stating that 'players 
will succeed if they have a confidence and part of my job is to help deliver that confidence to them.'
<br></br>
I was interested to see a discussion last week between Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher discussing goalkeeping in the Merseyside Derby.
The conclusion was both goalkeepers could have done more for the goals they conceded. That may seem harsh on Mignolet but Neville's
rationale for the criticism is well thought out and plausible. <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x26wpj4_jc-and-gn_tech">

<br></br>
Whilst everyone talks about Steven Gerrard being the reason Liverpool lost the title last year, I believe Mignolet's worrying inability 
to organise his defence and command his area were equally damaging, if not more so, than that slip in May. When Reina returned this summer, 
there were segments of Reds fans that called for his reinstatement to the team. That was never going to happen. Rodgers made his decision on 
that when Reina left for Napoli a year ago and Reina seemed to confirm that in his goodbye letter to fans at the time. Talk of Victor Valdes 
is rife, with reports his agent was at Anfield on Saturday as the Reds beat West Brom 2-1. Has Rodgers finally lost faith in the Belgian, and 
can he turn his Anfield career round? Liverpool will need him more this season as they struggle to match the heights of what was truly an 
exceptional season last year, mainly thanks to the dynamism of the attacking play. He needs confidence, and he needs competition. 
Brad Jones isn't a great keeper and not a realistic threat, putting Mignolet at risk of complacency. This must be guarded against. 
Something needs to change, and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.
