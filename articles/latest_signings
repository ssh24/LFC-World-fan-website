                              <b>Dejan Lovren</b>
                              <br></br>

Lovren made a good start to he's career with Liverpool by scoring on he's debut in the pre-season win against Borussia Dortmund.  Apart from that game, he has looked very average and hasn't added anything that we needed in defence. The problem is that at the moment there is no settled back four. He has been asked to play right sided centre back when Sakho has played, and left centre back when Skrtel has started. He needs time to settle and he will become a big player for us, he has the potential to be a leader and that's what we are crying out for in our defence.

<br></br>
<b>Javi Manquillo</b>
<br></br>

Manquillo has arguably been the most surprising of the signings made by Rodgers this season. He has settled very well and he's style suits what Rodgers is implementing. He is very good going forward and he's crossing is very good. He needs to work on he's positioning when we haven't got the ball, but that will come with time and experience.  We must remember that he is only 20 years of age, and that he played very little for Atletico Madrid last season. He has the potential to become our right back for many years to come.
 
<br></br>
<b>Alberto Moreno</b>
<br></br>

Moreno has been fantastic since he arrived from Sevilla for 12 million pounds. He made he's debut against Man City, and miss cleared a ball which they ended up scoring from, but he's overall performance was very good. In he's second game against Spurs, he was brilliant. He scored an outstanding individual goal, and fans were comparing him to John Arne Riise. He needs to improve defensively, but he's attacking side of the game is very good, and will only improve. We must not forget that he is only 22 years of age. He has the potential to become one of the best full backs in the world.

<br></br>
<b>Emre Can</b>
<br></br>

It is very difficult to analyse Emre Can, as he has been injured for most of the time he has been at Liverpool. Throughout pre-season, he looked sharp and he has a massive physical presence. Don't be surprised that when he's back fit, he will be playing in the big games as he will add a massive presence in our midfield and will thicken it up. He is only going to improve as he is only 20 years old. One thing that will help him get into the team is that he is very versatile; he can play in midfield as well as in defence. He may be considered a long term replacement for Steven Gerrard.

<br></br>
<b>Lazar Markovic</b>
<br></br>

Markovic has endured a tough start at Liverpool. Things haven't gone to plan for Markovic and has endured heavy criticism since he's 20 million pounds move from Benfica. We have to remember that he also is still very young, and it's been difficult for him to come in and make he's mark straight away. With time, he will become a very good player, and he can play across the line. He is rated as one of the best young players in the world and with time, he can fulfil he's potential with Liverpool.

<br></br>
<b>Adam Lallana</b>
<br></br>

Lallana didn't make the best of starts in he's Liverpool career, getting injured in the pre-season tour of USA. Since he has recovered from the injury, he has settled in well. He is a leader on the pitch which many don't recognise, and Rodgers is trying to build a young team full of leaders, e.g. Sakho and Lallana. Lallana can also play in a number of different positions, and is a very two footed player, with great balance. This was shown last weekend with he's goal against West Brom. This season he will be a key player and will be battling for position with Coutinho.

<br></br>
<b>Ricky Lambert</b>
<br></br>

It's a strange one with Lambert. He knows he is only going to be an impact player from the bench, so mentally it must be very difficult from him. We all saw that at Southampton he is a good footballer, good in the air as well as technically. He is very good with set pieces, and is an excellent penalty taker. We know that when he plays, he will give 100% for the team he supported since he was a little boy. He is a good impact player, and can offer us something different to what we have.

<br></br>
<b>Mario Balotelli</b>
<br></br>

Balotelli hasn't made the best of starts to life at Liverpool. He's job is to score goals, and at the moment he is simply not doing that. He needs to get in the box more, and he will score goals. He needs someone to play up top with him and with Sturridge coming back, hopefully it will help him and he can score some goals. He is working hard for the team, but needs to do more when we have the ball. If he's not going to score, then he needs to add assists to he's game, and with only one assist when he played for Man City, it looks very unlikely. He knows that this is he's last chance at a big club, and hopefully he can repeat what Sturridge has done.
