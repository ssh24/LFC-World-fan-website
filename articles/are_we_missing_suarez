                              Many kopites have recently expressed their opinion on our poor start to the 2014/15 season and the most popular topic has been "We are missing the suarez effect." Is it actually the fact we are missing LS7 or something else behind the scenes that has caught no one's attention?
                              <br></br>
It has been clear and cut that Luis wanted to leave Liverpool to go play for Barcelona. And I as a supporter, simply cannot blame him if he wishes to play for a different club. Neither can any other LFC supporter.
<br></br>
But what has been the actual issue is that Luis created a lot of 'extra' drama in order to leave us, and destroyed our club's reputation to an International level. And I hope, we all know the story behind it.
<br></br>
Anyways. So let's rewind back our life mentally towards the summer of 2014 - FIFA World Cup 2014, the biggest platform in the football world. Everyone was excited to watch how our goal machine would perform in the world's greatest event after having a phenomenal season with the reds. With two goals in his first game of the WC, pundits were already speculating another bag full of goals from Luis in this world cup.
<br></br>
However, everything changed during the Italy vs Uruguay game where Suarez bit the Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Our wonder boy got a 4 month ban from all football activity and nine match international ban.
<br></br>
Many sources suggested that the bit was intentional so he could leave us for a cheaper price. Probably the bitterest truth for any LFC supporter back then.
<br></br>
However, let's just say Suarez was not sold to Barcelona in the last transfer window; he would still be banned from all football activity at this moment in time. With Daniel Sturridge just recovering from a 3 weeks injury he picked up from the last international break, imagine how our life would be right now. Who would our number 1 striker be?
 <br></br>
Now, let's shift our view to something else. I strongly believe Balotelli was bought to act as Sturridge's partner in crime. Hence, if Suarez wasn't sold in the summer, we most likely wouldn't have bought MB45. With that being said, the only first choice striker we would have been left with would be Ricky Lambert - who has not lived up to his expectations at the club.
 <br></br>
So now the question is, are we still missing Luis or is it just our team chemistry that dropped from last season due to many reasons, for example: not being able to win the title after being so close, 9 (a quite big number) new transfers in during one window, and etc. We could have got a much worse start if the situation was similar and with Luis still with us. And what could have been even worse is that, we would be living with a fear within ourselves that Suarez might destroy our club's reputation again.
 <br></br>
So cheers, my fellow kopites, I strongly believe everything happens for the good. This squad will shine and we will go again (let it be this season, or 10 seasons from now). We will rise again! YNWA.
