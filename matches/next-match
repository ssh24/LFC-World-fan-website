	<h2 style="text-align:center">Newcastle FC vs Liverpool FC - Match Preview</h2>

<img src="../matches/Data/1.jpg" Width="400" align="center"/>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h3>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
It's not been a nice year on Tyneside. As the picture shows, Alan Pardew's men have had a truly torrid year. At one point last season, there was genuine concern that the Magpies could end up facing another spell banished to the Championship.
<br></br>
Newcastle is a proud city, with a rich footballing culture. The football is a uniting factor up North and there are few sides with as dedicated a following as the Toon Army. Up until three weeks ago, the Magpies had only won five games in 2014 and it was becoming all too familiar, and painful, for the club's fans. The inevitable calls for Alan Pardew's head started to roll in with protests launched at every game. It looks like there is very little chance of Mike Ashley ever being accepted by the fans, despite his tendancy to stand in the crowd like 'the common man' he so wants to be seen as.
 <br></br>
Football is a fickle thing. The North East side have won their last three games since a draw at Swansea, most notably a spirited, unifying performance against the champions, and holders, in the Carling Cup. Manchester City looked bedraggled and the Newcastle side had a combination of defence and quick attacking - a refreshing change from  what the rest of 2014 has offered. They will fancy their chances against a Liverpool side that, despite a last minute victory over Swansea on Tuesday night, are still looking to refind the electrifying form of last season.
<br></br>
The morale of the Reds should be boosted by their mid-week victory. It is very easy to see the current situation Rodgers' men find themselves in as catastrophic. Last year was a taste of the Liverpool times of old and it was always going to be extremely tough to reach those heights. Put into context, Steven Gerrard and co. are a win away from Wembley, two points off fourth and still in with a fighting chance in the Champions League. It is not all doom and gloom, no matter how much some people may tell you otherwise.
Without the SAS, the reds have lacked pace and intensity. Tuesday threatened to be another disappointing night as Marvin Emnes became the latest recipient of Liverpool's shaky defence. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Never fear, Mario is here. The much-criticised Italian came off the bench to volley home the impressive Fabio Borini's cross before Dejan Lovren lost his marker to seal a win with virtually the last act of the game. The Reds were by no means perfect but the manner of the win and the character they showed has been an improvement on some of the recent slow, laboured performaces of late. Mario 'why occasionally me' Balotelli proved the quality he can possess when he decides to put on his game face. 
<br></br>
I am of the belief that he struggles as a lone forward - when he played with Daniel Sturridge at White Hart Lane earlier in the season, the reds were an echo of the Liverpool of 13-14 and ripped into Spurs from the off. With Fabio Borini's pace, Balotelli could really prosper from the link up play this could provide, against a defence not known for their solidity.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Team News</h3>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
Liverpool travel to St James Park without Jose Enrique and Mamadou Sakho who are still restricted to the sidelines. Jon Flanagan has returned to training this week but is not match fit to appear, although he will hope to fight his way back into the side soon with right back the subject of Rodgers' rotation recently. The obvious absentee is Daniel Sturridge, who is still a few weeks away from a much needed return. Fabio Borini's impressive, energetic performance in the summer was reminiscent of his form whilst on loan at Newcastle's north east neighbours Sunderland. He may be an option for Brendan Rodgers to consider seriously. The one up top tactic has not worked for the Reds of late so perhaps it is time to go back to the pacey, intricate attacking which proved so successful for Liverpool sides of recent times.
<br></br>
Newcastle are sweating on the fitness of Papiss Cisse, who has been so key in their mini revival of late. Mike Williamson and Cheick Tiote are both also struggling to prove their fitness for the lunchtime clash having both missed the Magpies last two fixtures. 
<br></br>
Liverpool have to capitalise on Tuesday's victory. Consistency has been an issue this season with a good performance followed by a woeful one, repeat and so on. I would like to see an attacking side, full of intent to try and get on the front foot from minute one. This would be my side:

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">  
Playing both Borini and Balotelli gives Liverpool a greater variety of opportunities to break down what could be a stubborn defence. The explosiveness of the attacking play last season has led to many teams realising that it isn't possible to go at Liverpool, rather it is better to sit back and hit their leaky defence on the break. Borini gives Lallana and Sterling, two direct, attacking players another runner to drag the defence around and backed up by the purposeful running of Jordan Henderson there could be a real potential for progress in the final third. The back four and goalkeeper do pick themselves. Lovren and Skrtel are goalscoring defenders and the reds could do with re-finding that ability of theirs to add to the resources they possess to break down stubborn back fours, something they couldn't do against Hull last weekend.
</p>





     <h3 style="text-align:center">Predictions</h3>
     
     <p style="color:white;text-align:left;text-align:left">
     This fixture was Alan Pardew's first game in charge of Newcastle nearly four years ago. That day, the team in black and white ran out 3-1 winners on a dismal day for Roy Hodgson's haphazard side. This Liverpool are a different animal but are perhaps wounded by the confidence damaging results that have occurred so far this season.
     <br></br>
Three weeks ago, this game would have been put down as an almost guaranteed three points. After recent results though, the Newcastle team will be high on confidence and desperate to build on their success and really kick-start their season. The Reds will have to guard against this new found optimism and go about doing what they do best. I believe the Reds will get a result here - their side is undoubtedly stronger and, even without Daniel Sturridge, there are goals in the side. Brendan Rodgers will be determined to avoid getting the Hodgson treatment and bring three points back to Anfield to try and maintain this little bit of momentum that has gathered of late. Whatever happens, it is a big game for both sides, two sides in real need of some inspiration to get their seasons on the track they are expected to be on.
