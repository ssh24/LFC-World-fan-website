<h1>October Review</h1>

<p style="color:white"><b>Liverpool's form in October: L W W L D W</b></p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
The month of October got off to a horror start as the Reds made the trip to St. Jakob-Park for their Champions League Group B game against FC Basel. Having been left frustrated by a home draw in the Merseyside derby the previous weekend, Liverpool were hoping to make amends and see off the Swiss high-flyers.
<br></br>
Liverpool's season-opening troubles continued however, as they slipped to a Marco Streller effort, mid-way through the second half. Despite their passing and probing, Liverpool couldn't quite find top gear, and were forced to leave Swiss soil empty-handed.

</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
Fresh from European disappointment, Liverpool returned to league action, and welcomed the in-form West Brom to Anfield. The Baggies, having thrashed league newcomers Burnley, and edged both Hull and Tottenham Hotspur in previous weeks, were in confident form and keen continue their run of results.
<br></br>
Rickie Lambert was handed his first start for the Reds, who led at half-time through an impressive move made and finished by Adam Lallana - his first goal for Liverpool. His opener would soon be chalked out though, after a penalty kick from Saido Berahino levelled things for Alan Irvine's men. Liverpool were not to be denied however, as some good work by the energetic Raheem Sterling teed up new club vice-captain Jordan Henderson, who smashed home to seal all three points for the home side.

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
The end of a prolonged international break brought with it a trip to Loftus Road, for what resulted in another three points for the Reds, albeit with a little help from the Queens Park Rangers' defence. Liverpool took the lead through a Richard Dunne own goal, his tenth in Premier League history. For many this looked like it could secure the win, but for a tumultuous climax to the game. 
	<br></br>
	Liverpool's defensive frailties were exposed once more, with Eduardo Vargas on hand to equalise for the home side with minutes left. Phillipe Coutinho smashed home shortly after, to once again, look like the points were secure. Yet another equaliser, with more damage from the Chilean Vargas, left Liverpool looking foolish. Yet there was one more twist in the tale, after a dangerous cross from the ever-present Sterling was turned in by Stephen Caulker. 3-2 to the Reds, and only just!


</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">

More mid-week action and the Redmen were back playing European football; the cream of the crop was welcomed to Anfield in the shape of current European champions Real Madrid. Many among the media predicted nothing short of a thumping for Brendan Rodgers' men, who initially started with some spark and confidence. 
	<br></br>
	However they were outdone by probably the world's best player - Cristiano Ronaldo. Having never scored at Anfield before, the Portuguese superstar silenced the stadium with a world-class finish, which sparked a fifteen minute period which took Liverpool completely out of the game. 3-0 down in Europe at half-time; haven't we been here before?

</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">

Yet it was not to be on this occasion. While Liverpool were well-beaten on the pitch, one of Rodgers' new signings was taking a battering off. Mario Balotelli, substituted at half-time, was spotted swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe, in what turned out to be a rotten night for Liverpool.

</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
Balotelli was handed the chance for redemption during the next game, as he was handed a start against Hull City at Anfield. While he looked busy throughout, he could not quite guide the Reds to a goal, and the home fans were forced to sit out a bore 0-0 draw.
</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left">
The final game of the month saw Liverpool enter into domestic cup action, facing Swansea City at Anfield. With Hallowe'en very much on the horizon, the Reds were given a fright mid-way through the second half in the shape of a Marvin Emnes opener.
	<br></br>
	Yet it was a late flurry, featuring a cameo from that man Balotelli, which changed the outcome. Balotelli was introduced with eleven minutes to play, and made the most of his short time on the pitch. The Italian guided a Fabio Borini cross home, and played a massive part in the build-up to Dejan Lovren's winner; brief redemption for the fiery striker?
	<br></br>
	The month of October was certainly a testing time for many Liverpool fans. Yet all is not lost, with the Reds just three points off third place, and through to the quarter-finals of the league cup. Champions League form needs to improve, but with many of the new signings beginning to settle, and with Daniel Sturridge to return to the squad, happier times may well be on the way.
	<br></br>
Keep the faith.
